# CH1: What's the problem?

from "Engineering Trustworthy Systems" by Saydjari

## What is trustworthiness?

- A system is a collection of components that operate together to achieve some larger function
- Trust is confidence that a system has certain properties, like the CIA triad properties
- Most people trust their computers because they have no reason not to, or the fact that they shouldn't trust their computer never occurred to them
- Trusted computing is about proving that a computer should be trusted based upon evidence
